## What is MIG (Multi-Instance GPU)?

**MIG** allows a single physical GPU to be divided into **hardware-isolated slices**, each functioning as an independent GPU instance.

### Key Features:
- **Partitioned Resources:** Compute and memory resources are divided into MIG instances.
- **Hardware Isolation:** Instances are fully isolated.
- **Concurrent Execution:** Multiple workloads run simultaneously.

### Use Case:
- Resource-intensive tasks like AI inference or distributed training.
- Multi-tenant environments with predictable performance requirements.

## Key Features of MIG

| **Aspect**                  | **Description**                          |
|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------|
| **Resource Sharing**        | Physically partitions the GPU.           |
| **Concurrency**             | Multiple workloads run concurrently.     |
| **Isolation**               | Strong hardware-level isolation.         |
| **Performance**             | Consistent and predictable performance.  |
| **Overhead**                | Minimal overhead.                        |
| **Use Case**                | Resource-intensive or multi-tenant tasks.|

## MIG Strategies

MIG offers multiple strategies to allocate GPU resources. Below are the key strategies:

### **1. Mixed Strategy**
Combines different MIG profiles on a single GPU for heterogeneous workloads.

- Example:
  - 1 x `3g.40gb` (3 slices for training tasks)
  - 2 x `2g.20gb` (4 slices for inference tasks)

### **2. All-Balanced Strategy**
Divides the GPU into identical MIG instances for homogeneous workloads.

- Example:
  - 7 x `1g.10gb` (Each instance uses 1 slice.)

### **3. High-Performance Strategy**
Reserves the entire GPU for one workload.

- Example:
  - 1 x `7g.80gb` (Uses all slices.)

### **4. Memory-Balanced Strategy**
Prioritizes even memory distribution across MIG instances.

- Example:
  - 2 x `3g.40gb`
  - 1 x `1g.10gb`

### **5. Compute-Balanced Strategy**
Focuses on equal distribution of GPU compute resources.

- Example:
  - 3 x `2g.20gb`

### **6. Custom Strategy**
Fully customized configuration tailored to workload requirements.

## When to Use MIG

### Use **MIG** When:
- Workloads require strict isolation or predictable performance.
- Youâ€™re in a multi-tenant environment (e.g., Kubernetes or cloud setups).
- Tasks include AI inference or distributed training.
